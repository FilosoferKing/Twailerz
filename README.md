# Twailerz

**Description**: Twailerz is a website that connects the latest tweets via twitter about an upcoming 
movie and connects it with that trailer. It utilizes three different API's; Apple RSS Feeds, YouTube and Twitter. 
The list determining the latest movie trailers is pulled from the Apple RSS Feeds, along with the trailer image and description. The trailer video is pulled from the YouTube API. Then the most current tweets about that 
trailer are pulled from the Twitter API and shown alongside the movie trailer and description.<br>
**Additional Notes**: This project was completed by Team T.A.T, which included myself and two others during a one day hackathon. The only criteria was to use API's of our choice to bring information together.

##Features
* Every click brings you the most current and up-to-date information.
* Shows all relevant information next to eachother.

##Project Notes
  * The first discussion my team had was in determining what we wanted to bring together. We determined 
    that new trailers were always exciting and people are mostly curious what others opinions are of
    that movie. So we decided to bring them together in one place.
  * We worked in a scrum environement, holding many meetings throughout, utilizing stand-ups to communicate progress and         blockers to help determine where we stood and what could be done to improve upon our current position. This method           proved to be very effective and made merging the different aspects of our project seemless.
