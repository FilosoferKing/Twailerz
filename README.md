# Twailerz

**Description**: Twailerz is a website that connects the latest tweets via twitter about an upcoming 
movie and connects it with that trailer. It utilizes three different API's; Apple RSS Feeds, YouTube and Twitter. 
The list determining the latest movie trailers is pulled from the Apple RSS Feeds, along with the trailer image and description. The trailer video is pulled from the YouTube API. Then the most current tweets about that 
trailer are pulled from the Twitter API and shown alongside the movie trailer and description.<br>
**Additional Notes**: This project was completed by Team T.A.T, which included myself and two others during a one day hackathon. The criteria was to simply use API's to bring information together.

##Features
* All the movie trailers shown are up-to-date and most current.
* Alphabetical organization option for student name and student course.
* Add and delete students.
* Auto completion on form for courses.

##Project Notes
  * This is the first project I did using AJAX calls. Not only was it useful in learning 
    how to retrieve information, but also in how to pull specific information with JSON.
